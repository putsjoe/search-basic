<h1>
Rater </h1>

<h2> A basic rating system, that only allows two comments, of which can be negative or positive. </h2>

<h2> So far</h2>
<p>
    - Started creating a search function. <br>
    - A heavily broken search function.
<br><br>
- Using open source imdb database json returns for search. <br>
- However isnt very accurate and doesnt have everything. <br>
- Going to work on a custom one where dont use the picture, just the name and year and then the rating. <br>
</p>

<h2> Plan </h2>

<ol>
<li> Create a login that stays within the same page. -- No -- Can be done, proven this with timer, just needs etter code. </li>
<li> Create the basic rating applier. </li>
<li> Look into the way of creating the pages for new topics -- Wouldnt need pages as such, if its a single page app then it can just be pulled from the database to a template. </li>
<li> A way of adding up these ratings for an easy way to see whether something was good or not. </li>
<li> Win </li>
</ol>

<br> <br>

<h2> First </h2>
<p> Run a couple of tests with golang, PHP and Python on accessing and chnaging data within a database (Postgres or MySQL). </p>

<br>

<h2> 1 and 2 </h2>
<p>
Shall create this in basic javascript with calls to a Python(PHP??) (Golang??) backend with a MySQL database </p>
</p>
<br>

<h2> Plan 2.0 </h2>
<p>
 - Need to implement the API for imdb (Fake imdb) to display all.
 <br>
 - Classes for calls to database
 <br>
 - Set out the page (Single page).
 <br>
